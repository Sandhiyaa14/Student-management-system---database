Overview
This project is a Student Management System built using SQL to manage the relationships between students, courses, instructors, enrollments, and grades in a relational database. The system allows managing student data, courses they are enrolled in, the instructors teaching the courses, and the grades received by students.

Features:
Student Management: Keeps track of student information (name, email, gender).
Instructor Management: Stores information about instructors and their courses.
Course Enrollment: Enables students to enroll in courses and records the enrollment date.
Grade Management: Tracks the grades received by students for each course they are enrolled in.
SQL Queries: Supports queries to retrieve information like student names with courses, course names with instructors, and students with grades.
